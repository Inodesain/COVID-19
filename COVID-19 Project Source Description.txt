Source program of COVID-19 Historical Data Refinery, using Magic XPA Version 4.0 (an Application Development Tools from 
Magic Software Enterprises). 

Public Data Source from Johns Hopkins University after refined by Excel (need refined because of many data not standard, 
ie. Country Code : Mainland China, China, Taiwan, Taiwan*, South Korea, "Korea, South", Palestine, West Bank and Gaza). 
It will be standardize by this program to ISO 3166 Standard for better Geographic Visualization.

Another difficulties is data not come daily on same day, it is need to refined to display latest data on Dashboard. 
Also data from Cruise Ship need to separate column to avoid double counting.

We also analyze relation with Weather Condition and Population Data of the hardest hit location.

Hope this dataset will describe a global picture of what happened with "COVID-19 Pandemic" day to day and to assure our 
preparedness for the next potential pandemic.
